Code Setup Instructions

1. Datasets that were used, if they do not show up when cloning repo use this link to copy the dataset  
    a. Heart Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset  
    b. Diabetes Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset

2. The python version that I used when running this code is 3.11 please use 3.11 just to avoid any issues  

3. Next, do pip install -r requirements.txt  
    a. This will install the python packages necessary for the code to run if they do not already exist

4. Run main.py, when running, the code will create another directory called results  
    a. In results, all data will be generated and stored  
    b. Report_results are results that were generated when I(Saishrithik Sareddy) was running the code for the project
